# Physical AI Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Progressive Learning Structure
The book MUST follow a clear, progressive learning structure, starting from basic concepts and gradually advancing to more complex topics. Each chapter should build upon the previous ones to ensure a smooth learning curve for the reader.

### II. Practical, Hands-On Approach
The content MUST emphasize practical, hands-on examples and provide functional code snippets. Theory should be paired with implementation to facilitate active learning and real-world application.

### III. Comprehensive Topic Coverage
The book MUST provide comprehensive coverage of foundational Physical AI concepts, including ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Humanoid Robot Development, and Conversational Robotics. It will culminate in a capstone project that integrates these technologies.

### IV. Student-Friendly Explanations
Explanations MUST be student-friendly, using clear and simple language. Concepts should be related to real-world applications to make them more tangible and understandable for learners.

### V. Documentation and Formatting Standards
All content, including code and documentation, MUST adhere to proper documentation standards and maintain consistent formatting. This ensures clarity, maintainability, and a professional presentation of the material.

### VI. Accessibility and Readability
The material MUST be accessible and readable for individuals from diverse learning backgrounds. This includes using inclusive language, providing alternative explanations for complex topics, and ensuring the layout is easy to navigate.

## Technology Stack

The project will use Docusaurus for building the online book format. All examples and projects will be compatible with the specified versions of ROS 2, Gazebo, and NVIDIA Isaac platforms.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributors must follow the established documentation and formatting standards. All new content or changes must be submitted via pull requests and reviewed for compliance with the constitution's principles before being merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the guiding document for the project. Any amendments require a formal proposal, review, and approval process. All contributions MUST be checked for compliance with these principles.
