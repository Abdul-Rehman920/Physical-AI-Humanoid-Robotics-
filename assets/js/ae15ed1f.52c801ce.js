It\u2019s more than just an operating system; it's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions designed to simplify the intricate process of building sophisticated robot applications. From managing sensor data streams and controlling actuators to orchestrating complex behaviors, ROS 2 offers the foundational infrastructure upon which intelligent robots are built. Understanding ROS 2 is not just about learning a technology; it\u2019s about embracing a collaborative ecosystem that empowers roboticists worldwide to accelerate innovation and tackle some of the most challenging problems in automation and autonomy.
