Traditionally, AI research has focused on algorithms, data processing, and cognitive simulations that exist primarily in software, often detached from real-world interaction. While this approach has yielded remarkable advancements in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and game playing, it often grapples with the "symbol grounding problem"\u2014the challenge of connecting abstract symbols and concepts to concrete experiences in the physical world. Physical AI addresses this by integrating AI systems directly with robotic hardware, enabling them to perceive, act, and learn through embodied experience.'}),"\n",(0,a.jsx)(i.p,{children:"This integration fundamentally changes how intelligence is developed and expressed. Instead of merely processing information, a physical AI system must contend with the complexities of physics, real-time sensory input, motor control, and unpredictable environments.

The concept draws heavily from embodied cognition, a theory suggesting that cognitive processes are deeply dependent on the body's interactions with its environment.
